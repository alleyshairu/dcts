# Zomato Data Analysis, Predictive Modelling and Docker Deployment

## Context

We are trying to analyze all restaurants in the Sydney area in 2018 with the objective of predicting each restaurant's potential success. As a data science student, the goal is to find the unknown patterns, or hidden gems that are impacting the performance of the resturants. Additionally, the goal is also to go through the complete data science project life cycle from development to deployment.

## Notebook Summary
1.  Problem Statement
2.  Goal/Outcome

    **Part A**
3. Loading Datasets 
4.  Data Inspection 
5.  No of unique cusinies served by Sydney restaurants in 2018
6.  Top 3 suburbs with mos restaurants in Sydney 
7.  Agree or Disagree with 'Restaurants with excellent rating are mostly very expensive while those with poor rating are rarely expensive'
8.  Exploratory Data Analysis
    1. Explore numerical variables 
    2. Explore categorical variables 
    3. Visualize the missing values for important columns such as cost, cuisine, rating, and votes
    4. Find outliers in the cost variables. 
    5. Find the correlation between columns.
9.  Cuisine Denstiry Map

    **Part B**
10. Data Cleaning 
11. Data Encoding
12. Identify Source And Target Variables
13.  Split Data into separate training and test
